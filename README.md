# Employee Performance & Retention Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using demographic, salary, performance, and employment details. The goal is to identify key factors influencing retention and build predictive models to support HR in data-driven decision-making.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing for quality assurance.
- Explore attrition trends through statistical analysis and visualizations.
- Build machine learning models to predict employee attrition.
- Provide actionable insights for HR retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning

## 📊 Key Steps
1. Data preprocessing (duplicates removal, encoding, cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – attrition trends by performance, salary, tenure, and department.
3. Statistical & probability analysis (Bayes’ theorem, hypothesis testing).
4. Predictive modeling using Random Forest and Deep Learning.
5. Evaluation and interpretation of model results.
